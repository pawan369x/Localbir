            <h2>Is Paragliding in Bir Billing Safe?</h2>
            <p>This is the #1 question we get asked. And the honest answer is: <strong>Yes, but only if you choose the right pilot.</strong></p>
            
            <p>Bir Billing is the world's second-highest paragliding site, and it attracts pilots from all over the globe. However, not every pilot flying here is certified for commercial tandem flights.</p>

            <h3>3 Things to Check Before You Fly</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pilot License:</strong> Ask to see their physical license card. It should be valid for the current year.</li>
                <li><strong>Equipment Condition:</strong> Look at the glider. Is it faded? Are the lines frayed? Old gear is a major risk factor.</li>
                <li><strong>Insurance:</strong> Does the operator provide insurance? Professional agencies always do.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>At Local Bir, we have a zero-tolerance policy for safety. We only work with pilots who have 5+ years of experience and top-rated gear.</p>
